  ## Installation
  Go to the Github link which will be provided at the bottom, download the code, make changes to your seeds folder if you'd like, update the connection for your best fit. Then run these commands in the terminal, make sure you are in the main folder
  -npm i (this is to install all the necessary packages)
  -node seeds/index.js
  -node server.js (unfortunately, we weren't able to get the server to connect to the Database)
 
  ## Issues
  We ran into issues getting the Database to connect to the Server. This therefore didn't allow for us to deploy to heroku. 

  ## Motivation
  This was a group project that turned out to be quite fun! The project was due in October, so that was our motivation for it being around Halloween.

  ## Why?
  Coding bootcamp project

  "You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six weeks to create a real-world full-stack application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create"

  ## Problem Solved?
  Good starter code for a voting app... can be used for whatever category of voting you'd like.  

  ## Things Learned
  How to use the MERN stack and how to structure our code. Handlebars.js was definetly hard to "handle" ba dum shh.
